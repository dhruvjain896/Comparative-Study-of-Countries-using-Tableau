# Comparative-Study-of-Countries-using-Tableau

## Description
### A hypothetical company is expanding and wants to open new branches in various parts of the world. The dashboard compares various parameters such as income, life insurance share, market share, penetration, ratio of reinsurance accepted, and retention ratio of different countries using the sample insurance dataset and world development indicators dataset. The objective is to strategize market penetration and to target new customers.

## Datasets

### 1. Created a geographic map showing the countries' fields. Colored the map based on the income column from the secondary dataset
### 2. Included income group filter in the dashboard
### 3. Included a webpage to show data from the world bank webpage driven by an URL action from a geography graph
### 4. Created a KPI Table to show the comparison between the selected period and the period prior to the selected one
### 5. Created two parameters for Year Selection and Category Selection
### 6. Category parameter includes life insurance share, market share, penetration, ratio of reinsurance accepted, and retention ratio
### 7. Created a calculated field to calculate the Growth %
### 8. Created a table to show these values
### 9. Created Growth Indicator Shapes based on the Growth %
### 10. Growth indicator displays Negative, No Change, and Positive as values and corresponding shapes against it
### 11. Created a trend line to show the selected category values
### 12. The line shows an arrow or triangle at the last mark
